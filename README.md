# ZipCheck

A cybersecurity tool for checking security against file downloads in the browser.

## Description

A WIP cybersecurity tool that, as a Chrome extension, will intercept file downloads, break down downloaded file (e.g. decompress ZIP file) into original contents (and check for password protection and prompt for password for decryption if needed), check said contents against VirusTotal, and provides security rating information about said contents.

Made by Team WeLoveSigmas for Singapore's Div0's HackSmith V5.0 (cybersecurity tool hackathon).
